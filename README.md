# SagePay.IntegrationKit
The source code for the SagePay Integration Kit for .Net

## Note 1
The original code for this repository was originally provided by SagePay. I asked them for the code as I discovered a bug when the SagePay API returns a status of `NOTAVAILABLE` for the `3DSecure` status flag. SagePay were fully aware of this, and told me:

>Unfortunately this is a known issue with the .NET kit but there is no fix as of yet

They kindly provided the source to me and I have added in the (very simple!) fix. Additionally, various parts have been updated to use the more modern features of C# 6. As such, you will need Visual Studio 2015 (or higher) to view this project.

## Note 2
You are free to use this code as you wish but I take ZERO responsibility for anything that may go wrong!

## Note 3
If the nice people at SagePay ask me to take this down, I will do so without hesitation as it is still their original code. However, it would be very nice if they give me their blessing instead!
